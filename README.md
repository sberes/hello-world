Hello Everyone!

This is just me typing something about myself.  I have lived one-half of my lifespan or three-quarters of it and I am trying something new and out of my element.  I am the oldest person in class, and I am sure there is doubt as to whether or not I will grasp the information.  I set my mind to swim pier-to-pier this year with no previous ocean swimming experience.  After two-heart surgeries and determination, I did it and I did it very successfully!  So, I may be slower than the rest of the class, but determination always wins!  The turtle and the hare...
